# Bio
###Description: 
An anonymous, virtual “buddy” to help connect survivors with support resources via a conversation-like interface.

###Why: 
Provide easy access to support resources, and to bridge the gap between people who need support with professionals who are qualified to help. 

###Problem to solve: 
We’re not trying to solve the entire problem of sexual assault/trauma with our app - we can't - but we can try to inspire communication and survivor empowerment by bridging the gap between people who need help, and professionals who are qualified to do so. 

###Design Principles: 
Speed, accessibility, and user anonymity.

#Responses

User 1.
Prefer to be in a private place, be present and looking at me. Engaged, asking or listening depending on the timing. 
Reputable, someone i know really well. 
Support groups, doctors, apps low budget advice, friends family,  religious (church temple), maybe a dog 
Empathetic, compassionate, optimistic
Supportive, encouraging
Circle of other people to find a direction more appropriate more than myself. Maybe seek a professional.
Get them to a safe place, extract them
Trust my banking app a lot, my messages

User 2 - 
Privacy, empathetic, accredited, safe to be vulnerable and not be judged 
Similar to #1; confidentiality.
Some websites - can’t think of specifics.
Listening, doesn’t need to categorize, empowerment to make own decisions.  Not a brick wall. Taking information in, validating emotions.
“That sucks.” - affirming crummy feelings; validating.  Simple- don’t say too much; meaning can get lost. 
Doesn’t know. Google.
Doesn’t know. WOuld Google physical trauma support/tips. Shared personal experience - tired of authority bouncing survivors around.
Doesn’t trust any - mentions people selling information anonymously. 
N/A
Doesn’t know anyone that uses - if they did exist, they would not want the app to ‘visible’ on phone.  (Like not mentioning that you have a therapist). 
NA
Simple purpose, with set/simple goals.


User 3 -
1.  Confidentiality.
2.  Depends on what the site plans on doing with the info, would feel more comfortable if             anonymous.
3.  Doctors, friends, family, online counseling, phone hotlines.
4.  Professional approach on things, not judgmental.
5.  That they are there for me.
6.  Internet, personal experience. 
7.  Depends on severity, non-judgemental source.
8.  FitnessPal, PayPal, Wellsfargo.
9.  Have a lot of control on who sees my info, a sense of higher security.
10.  Lean less towards apps you have to download, more so websites for ambiguity, able to        cover your tracks. Apps on a phones are harder to hide quickly.

1.Privacy 
2. Not having to speak to someone face to face

5  Not alone, alot of people share the same experiences and there are ways to help 
6.  Internet
7.  Internet, Police Station
8.  Paypal
9. Guarantee Privacy 
10. It's a good thing, easier access to find help. 

User 5.
1)A trusted source. Knowing that if I share confidential information I can trust it to stay confidential.
2)How well I know whoever will be receiving the information. Either a trusted friend or a trusted professional.
3)very few off the top of my head. Therapists or hotlines(none specifically)
4)Trusted by others. Proven track record of helping people in similar situations. Judgement free environment.
5)Depends on scenario. Preferably a critical and objective critique of my situation.
6)Start with google. If nothing comes up I would go to my schools community where I know these resources are available.
7)Same as above
8)Venom, WellsFargo App
9)Solid security with FDIC
10)I think there is a place for apps like this but being able to go to an app and talking with a trusted individual could be hard over text. I think for an app like this to be successful it would have to add an element that gives a face-to-face experience.
11)Maybe. Would probably call a professional first.
12) Local information on how to contact a professional in the field of interest. Being that most of these professionals are doctors then I would also want information on what sorts of insurance they accept.
